# Capstone-Project-Healthcare - PGP

# Problem Statement:
- NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
- The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

I worked on this capstone project towards completion of final assessment for PGP in Data Science course from Simplilearn-Purdue University. My job was to analyze the datasets from NIDDK consisting of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more. I created and trained a number of Machine Learning models using various classification algorithms for prediction of diabetes in patients. I created a dashboard for visualization of various parameetrs and finally deployed model at this link: https://python-flask-ml.herokuapp.com/
